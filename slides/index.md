- F# to JS compiler
- Framework agnostic
- Plugin system
- Source maps
- Batteries charged: F# core library and some .NET BCL
- Adheres to JS standards
- Compatible with JS developments tools: [Babel](http://babeljs.io), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com), [WebPack](https://webpack.github.io)

### WHY FABLE?

JavaScript is evolving at rapid pace, do we need a new language?


- Static typing
- Type inference
- Whitespace indentation (optional)
- Intellisense
- REPL
- Expression based programming
- Pattern Matching
- Active Patterns
- Immutable by default
- Partial application / Pipelines
- Functional core library (LINQ on steroids!)
- List, array and iterable comprehensions
- Structural comparisons
- Observables
- String formatting
- Generics, unions, records and tuples
- Type aliases
- Custom operators
- DSL embedded in the language
- Typed-stateless Async programming
- Custom computation expressions
- OOP: Inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes
- Overloading, type extensions
- Units of measure
- Type providers (coming to Fable)
- Circular dependency restriction
- Compiler directives
- Don Syme will retweet you!
